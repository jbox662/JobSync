# Supabase Setup Instructions for Your Project

## ✅ Credentials Configured
Your Supabase credentials have been successfully added to the app:
- **Project URL**: `https://fyymdsvxylcnbeacwgkd.supabase.co`
- **Anon Key**: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...` (configured)

## 🚀 Next Steps Required

### 1. Set Up Database Schema
You need to create the required tables in your Supabase project:

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**: 
   - Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/fyymdsvxylcnbeacwgkd
   - Login to your Supabase account

2. **Access SQL Editor**:
   - Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New Query"

3. **Execute Database Schema**:
   - Copy the entire contents of `supabase-schema.sql` from your project root
   - Paste it into the SQL editor
   - Click "Run" to execute all the statements

### 2. Verify Tables Created
After running the schema, you should see these tables in your database:
- `workspaces` - Business/organization data
- `workspace_members` - Team member management
- `customers` - Customer information
- `parts` - Parts inventory
- `labor_items` - Labor services
- `jobs` - Project/job management
- `quotes` - Customer quotes
- `invoices` - Billing and invoices
- `sync_events` - Change tracking for sync

### 3. Test App Connection
Once the database schema is set up:
1. Restart your app (if running)
2. The sync status should change from "Supabase not configured" to "Workspace not linked"
3. You can now create a business workspace through the onboarding flow

## 🔧 Configuration Status
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Updated with your credentials
- ✅ **App Configuration**: Ready to connect
- ⏳ **Database Schema**: Needs to be executed (see steps above)
- ⏳ **Workspace Setup**: Ready after schema is created

## 📱 How to Use After Setup
1. **Create Business**: Use the onboarding flow to create your first workspace
2. **Invite Team**: Share invite codes with team members
3. **Add Data**: Start adding customers, parts, and creating jobs
4. **Sync**: All data will automatically sync across devices

## 🆘 Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
1. Ensure all SQL statements in `supabase-schema.sql` executed successfully
2. Check that Row Level Security policies were created
3. Verify your Supabase project is active and not paused
4. Use the "Test Connection" feature in the app's Supabase setup screen

## 📊 Database Schema Overview
Your database will include:
- **Multi-tenant structure** with workspace isolation
- **Automatic timestamps** with triggers
- **Soft deletes** for data preservation
- **Change tracking** for synchronization
- **Row Level Security** for data protection

Ready to sync your business data across all devices! 🎉
