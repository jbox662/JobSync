# üìä Database Setup Guide

## üéØ STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Locate the Schema File
The database schema file is located in your project root directory:

**File Location**: `supabase-schema.sql`
- Same folder as `App.tsx`, `package.json`, and other main files
- 239 lines of SQL commands
- Contains all tables, indexes, triggers, and security policies

### Step 2: Access Your Supabase Dashboard
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: **https://app.supabase.com/project/fyymdsvxylcnbeacwgkd**
3. Login to your Supabase account

### Step 3: Open SQL Editor
1. In the Supabase dashboard, look for the left sidebar
2. Click on **"SQL Editor"**
3. Click **"New Query"** button

### Step 4: Copy the Schema
1. Open the `supabase-schema.sql` file from your project
2. **Select ALL content** (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A)
3. **Copy** (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C)

### Step 5: Execute the Schema
1. In the Supabase SQL Editor, **paste** all the content
2. Click the **"Run"** button (or press Ctrl+Enter)
3. Wait for all commands to execute (should take 10-30 seconds)

### Step 6: Verify Success
After execution, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Multiple "Success. No rows returned" messages
- ‚úÖ All tables created
- ‚úÖ All indexes created  
- ‚úÖ All policies created

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### If SQL Execution Fails:
- Ensure you copied the ENTIRE file content
- Check that all commands executed (scroll through results)
- Re-run any failed commands individually

### If App Still Shows "Not Configured":
- Restart your React Native development server
- Force-close and restart the app
- Check the console for any errors

### If You See Errors:
- Most "duplicate" errors are okay (means tables already exist)
- Permission errors might indicate wrong Supabase project
- Contact support if persistent issues occur
